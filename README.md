# SIEM-Tool

<hr>

## Welcome 
<p>
    In this project, I will guide you through using Microsoft Azure and demonstrate how to create rules for detecting various events using a virtual machine. In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding how to analyze data, interpret its meaning, and determine the necessary steps to achieve specific goals is critically important.
</p>

## What is Microsoft Azure? 
<p>
    It is a cloud computing platform that individuals and businesses can use for various purposes. Imagine a room filled with hundreds of computers owned by Microsoft. Now, picture your business experiencing heavy surges during promotional or seasonal campaigns. If your website is hosted on fixed-resource physical servers—whether on-premises or in a data center—you might face challenges.
</p>
<p>
    Why? Because too much traffic could overwhelm the system, leading to <b> slow speeds → unhappy customers → customers leaving → missed sales = loss of revenue. </b>
</p>
<p>
    Now, if that business were to use a hosting solution such as <b>Azure</b>, they would have the ability to dynamically scale their resources without worrying about slow speeds. On traditional physical servers, scaling requires purchasing additional hardware—a time-consuming and costly process.
</p>
<p>
    With cloud computing, companies still rely on physical computers housed in specific locations. However, the difference lies in the scale: there are hundreds of these servers available, allowing you to rent only what you need, when you need it, instead of buying and maintaining extra hardware for your servers.
</p>
<p>
    Would you prefer a solution that's quick and easy or one that's slow and difficult?
