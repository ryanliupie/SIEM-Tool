## Welcome 
<p>
  In this project, I will teach you how to use Microsoft Azure and how you can create rules for detecting different events with the addition of a VM. In the realm of CyberSecurity, it is extremely important how to analyze data, what it means, and what steps you need to take to achieve a certain goal. 
</p>

## What is Microsoft Azure? 
<p>
  It is a cloud computing platform that many people can use either for personal reasons or business reasons. Picture a room with hundreds of computers that Microsoft owns. Now you have a business that experiences heavy surges during promotional and seasonal campaigns. If the website is hosted on fixed resource physical servers either on-premise or at a data center, customers may complain. This is because if there is too much traffic; overwhelming the system causing <b>slow speeds --> customers not happy --> customers click off --> customers don't buy = loss in revenue. </b>
</p>
<p>
  Now if that business were to use a hosting solution such as <b> Azure </b>, then they have the abiility to dynamically scale their resources without having to worry about those slow speeds. This is because on traditional physical servers, you would need to buy more physical hardware. Mind you, with cloud computing, companies still have these physical computers in some location. The difference is that there are hundreds of them that allow you to use as much as you need by renting it out, rather than buying additional hardware for your server. Would you rather try to buy something easy and quick, or hard and slow?
