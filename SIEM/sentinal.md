## What is Microsoft Sentinal? 
<p>
  After creating the VM, you can simply log into it by downloading the RDP file and logging in with the password you created. However, since we want to monitor when we log in with RDP 3389 and sent an alert back to us, we need to add a tool. The tool in question is <b> Microsoft Sentinal </b>, where it is a cloud-native Security and Event Management (SIEM) solution. This helps users or organizations monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats.
