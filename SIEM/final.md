    I learned a lot of new technologies in this project and how they interact with each other. It was quite interesting to see all of the MISP indicators and the specific types of threats they represented, as well as integrating that with centralized management using Azure.

    Going forward, I will continue to explore new technologies and broaden my skill set to truly understand where I want to focus, especially in the vast field of cybersecurity. If you are like me, donâ€™t stop learning new thingsâ€”even if itâ€™s something as simple as baking cookies. Try everything!

    Thanks for following along until the end!
