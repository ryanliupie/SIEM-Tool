  Under the Threat management tab, click on <b> Incidents </b>. You should see that there are 0 incidents that have been logged. This is because we have not logged in via RDP 3389 yet. Since we specified to filter out System accounts, there are no incidents. If we did not specifiy it, we would get ton of alerts as background processes keep running.
